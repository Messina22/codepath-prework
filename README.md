## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used a stackoverflow post to find out the syntax on how to write a random number generator to make a different pattern sequence each time the game is started.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge that I encountered during this submission was I have never seen any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript syntax before this project. I have had classroom experience programming but I have yet to take a course where I programmed for webpage development. Luckily, since I have had programming experience I was able to pick up on how the syntax that was given in the pre work documentation was structured. I did this by using the variable names that were provided in the documentation to figure out how they related to the display of the project. I would also play around with variables to see how they changed the preview window. Another challenge I encountered was that I had to frequently leave working on the project because I would have to finish other work that I was working on. This created the problem that sometimes I had to remember what I was working on and how the project was structured. I overcame this problem as time went on as I understood more of the syntax and it was quicker for me to look at what I wrote and understand what it did.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
One question that I have about web development is how do you write code for a webpage that is displaying data and that is constantly being updated? For real webpages I assume that there are many large databases that it needs to pull from and display the needed data. Another question I have is how web pages are connected together in large web sites? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on the project the first change I would make would be to make the pattern repeat after a short amount of time if the user does not input an answer so the user can see the pattern again if they missed one light in the sequence. A visual change that I would make would make the buttons sectors in a circle so it resembles an actual Simon says game. I would also implement a button which would create a infinite version of the game to allow the user to see what high score the user could achieve.
